# <i>Daphnia magna</i> Copy Number Variation Analysis
## (In progress...)

### Script list
* trimming.sh: raw reads quality control and trimming  
* speedseq.sh: raw reads mapping
* speedseq_BlueBEAR_QOS: same as previous script, but designe for BlueBEAR QOS
* mergeBam.sh: merge together bam file of sequencing replicates
* lumpy.sh: call copy number variation from file aligned with SpeedSeq (Not working because Lumpy is not properly installed in the BLUEbear virtual machine. IT service is investigating at the time of writing.).
