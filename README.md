This repository was created to share the scripts used in the above group projects and allow the repeatability and reproducibility of the work done.

The scripts are divided in three folders:
* VarianCalling: from quality control to post-mapping analysis for SNP variant extraction.
* GenomeWideAssociationStudy: from GWAS analysis to selection of relevant genes for evoution and plasricity.
* CopyNumberVariation: from quality control to post-mapping analysis for copy number variation (in progress).
